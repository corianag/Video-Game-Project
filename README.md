# Video-Game-Project

GameCo wants to use data to inform the development of new games. As such, you’ve been asked to perform a descriptive analysis of a video game data set to foster a better understanding of how GameCo’s new games might fare in the market.The stakeholder’s expectation is that Video Games Sales for the various geographic reasons have stayed the same over time. 

## Objective

To distribute the marketing budget in order to maximize return on investment. 

## Data Set

● It covers historical sales of video games (for games that sold more than 10,000 copies) spanning different platforms, genres, and publishing studios. 
● It tracks the total number of units of games sold (not financial figures) from 1980 to 2016.
● The numbers represent units sold in millions. When you see the number “1.2,” for instance, this represents a total of 1.2 million units sold.
● This data was drawn from the website VGChartz https://www.vgchartz.com
● To get a better sense of the approach used to gather and correlate this data, take a look at VGChartz’s methodology: https://www.vgchartz.com/methodology.php
